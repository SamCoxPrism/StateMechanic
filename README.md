=============

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/StateMechanic.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StateMechanic/)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/lx2an4nfb743gt6v?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/canton7/statemechanic)

StateMechinic is a simple but powerful hierarchical state machine library.
It supports entry, exit, and transition handlers; custom data passed with events; child state machines; custom state subclasses; advanced transitions; and more.


Installation
------------

StateMechanic is available as a PCL profile 259 (.NET 4.5, ASP.NET Core 1.0, Windows Phone 8.1) on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StateMechanic).

Either open the package console and type:

```
PM> Install-Package StateMechanic
```

Or right-click your project -> Manage NuGet Packages... -> Online -> search for StateMechanic in the top right.

Symbols are available.
If you want to step into the StateMechanic code itself, go to Debug -> Options and Settings -> General, and make the following changes ([more details](https://github.com/GitTools/GitLink)).

1. Turn **off** "Enable Just My Code"
2. Turn **off** "Enable .NET Framework source stepping". Yes, it is misleading, but if you don't, then Visual Studio will ignore your custom server order and only use its own servers.
3. Turn **on** "Enable source server support". You may have to OK a security warning.


Quick Start
-----------

Note that the code snippets in this README are available as runnable code samples in [the Samples project](https://github.com/canton7/StateMechanic/tree/master/Samples).

Here's a quick introduction to the basics.
We'll create a state machine to represent a drinks dispenser.

```csharp
// First off, create a state machine. It's recommended to give it a name
// (which helps debugging), but you don't have to.
var stateMachine = new StateMachine("State Machine");

// Whenever we create a state machine, we need to give it an initial state. This
// is the state which the state machine starts in.
var awaitingMoney = stateMachine.CreateInitialState("Awaiting Money");

// We then add the other states in the staate machine.
var awaitingSelection = stateMachine.CreateState("Awaiting Selection");
var dispensing = stateMachine.CreateState("Dispensing");

// Next, we'll create the events.
var moneyReceived = new Event("Money Received");
var selectionReceived = new Event("Selection Received");
var dispenseComplete = new Event("Dispense Complete");

// Finally, we create transitions between our states based on these events.
awaitingMoney.TransitionOn(moneyReceived).To(awaitingSelection);
awaitingSelection.TransitionOn(selectionReceived).To(dispensing);
dispensing.TransitionOn(dispenseComplete).To(awaitingMoney);

// See that the state machine starts in the initial state
Assert.AreEqual(awaitingMoney, stateMachine.CurrentState);
Assert.True(awaitingMoney.IsCurrent);

// Fire events directly. This will throw an exception if there is no transition
// from the current state.
moneyReceived.Fire();

// Alternatively, you can try and fire the event - this won't throw on failure,
// but will return a bool indicating whether it succeeded.
moneyReceived.TryFire();

Assert.AreEqual(awaitingSelection, stateMachine.CurrentState);
```

You'll notice that states and events are instances, rather than being enums (as in other state machine libraries).


State Machines
--------------

The first thing to do is to create a `new StateMachine()`.
It is advisable to give you state machine a name (which is useful when debugging it), but this is not essential.

```csharp
var stateMachine = new StateMachine("MyStateMachine");
```

`StateMachine` has a few useful events:

 - `Transition` will be raised whenever a transition occurs (either one this state machine or on one of its children). This is very useful for logging: you can track exactly what your application is doing, for free, with this log output.
 - `TransitionNotFound` will be raised whenever an `Event.Fire()` or an `Event.TryFire()` fails. In the case of [recursive transitions](recursive-transitions) and `Event.TryFire()`, this is the *only* way to know that the transition failed. Again, useful for logging.
 - `Faulted` is raised whenever the state machine [faults](#exceptions-and-faulting), i.e. an exception is raised by a transition or state entry/exit handler.

Various properties indicate the current state of the state machine (`CurrentState`, `CurrentChildState`) or (in the case of hierarchical state machines) whether the state machine is active (`IsActive`).

There is also a method, `Reset()`, to reset the state machine to its initial state (which will also clear any faults), methods to [serialize and deserialize](#serialization) the state machine, and a method to [print](#printing-state-machines) it.

There are also properties to inspect the state machine's states, parent state, etc.


States
------

In StateMechanic, states are instances of the class `State` (although [you can customise this](#custom-state-subclasses)).

Every state machine must have an initial state, this is the state which the state machine is in to start with, and which it returns to when you call `StateMachine.Reset()` (this isn't quite true for [child state machines](#child-state-machines)).
To create the initial state, do the following.
As before, the name is recommended but not mandatory.

```csharp
State initialState = stateMachine.CreateInitialState("InitialState");
```

You may only create one initial state, but you must create it.

You will also want to create some other states:

```csharp
State someState = stateMachine.CreateState("SomeState");
```

Notice how states are strongly associated with a state machine.

State entry handlers are executed whenever the state is entered, and likewise exit handlers are always executed when the state is exited.
Creating an entry/exit handler pair is a very powerful tool: you can make sure that the exit handler always undoes whatever the entry handler did.

Entry and exit handlers are passed an object containing various bits of useful information: the states being transitioned from and to, and the event which triggered that transition.

```csharp
var someState = stateMachine.CreateState("Some State")
    .WithEntry(info => Console.WriteLine($"Entry from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}"))
    .WithExit(info => Console.WriteLine($"Exit from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}"));

// You can also set the EntryHandler and ExitHandler properties directly
someState.EntryHandler = info => Console.WriteLine($"Entry from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}");
someState.ExitHandler = info => Console.WriteLine($"Exit from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}");
```


Events
------

The other component of a state machine is its events.
Unlike other state machine libraries, StateMechanic does not use an enum type for its events: this is so that the event data mechanism fits into the picture without ugly hacks.

To create an event:

```csharp
Event someEvent = new Event("SomeEvent");
```

Again, names are recommended but not mandatory.

Once you have created some transitions which occur on the event, you can fire the event using `Event.Fire()` or `Event.TryFire()`.
The difference is that `Event.Fire()` will throw an exception if no transition (whose [guard](#transition-guards) returned true) could be found on that event from the current state, whereas `Event.TryFire()` will return false.

When naming your events, it helps to think of them as representing outside influences, rather than as having a particular effect on the state machine.
That is, you should create one event per "thing" which can happen, rather than one event for each type of change you want to make to the state machine.

For example, if you are building a state machine to control user nagivation through an application, you should name your events after things that the user can do ("LogInClicked", "MainMenuClicked", "ViewSettingsClicked") rather than actions that the state machine can perform ("LogIn", "NavigateToMainMenu", "NavigateToSettings").
The *point* of a state machine is that different actions can be performed when the same event occurs, depending on the current state of the state machine (e.g. "Log In" may do different things depending on whether the user is currently logged in),
In other words, you should never have to decide which event to fire when something happens: the event to fire should be obvious, and the logic of what to do when that event is fired is encoded in the state machine.

Note that Event, unlike State, was not created from a factory method on StateMachine.
However, it is still associated with a state machine hierarchy (and becomes associated with it the first time that you define a tranition involving that event).
This means that you cannot use the same event with multiple separate state machines, and you cannot fire an event until it has been used to define at least one transition.

This decision was made in order to allow you to write `private readonly Event someEvent = new Event("SomeEvent");` in your classes, reducing the amount of boilerplate.


Transitions
-----------

Transitions allow you to specify that when the state machine is in a particular state, and a given event is fired, the state machine should transitions to another particular state.

```csharp
someState.TransitionOn(someEvent).To(someOtherState);
```

You can also register a handler on a transition: whenever that transition occurs, the handler will be called.
As with state entry/exit handlers, transition handlers receive an object containing useful information about the transition.

If there is data associated with the event ([see below](#event-data)), then this is also available.

```csharp
someState.TransitionOn(someEvent).To(someOtherState)
    .WithHandler(info => Console.WriteLine($"Transition from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}"));
```

You can also set the Handler property directly:

```csharp
var transition = someState.TransitionOn(someEvent).To(someOtherState);
transition.Handler = info => Console.WriteLine($"Transition from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}");
```


Inner Self Transitions
----------------------

A state is allowed to transition to itself.
This is a useful way of running some code when an event is fired, but only if the state machine is in a particular state.
By default, both the exit and entry handlers will also be invoked in this case.
If you don't want this, then create an inner self transition instead.

```csharp
var state = stateMachine.CreateInitialState("State")
    .WithEntry(i => Console.WriteLine("Entry"))
    .WithExit(i => Console.WriteLine("Exit"));

state.TransitionOn(event1).To(state).WithHandler(i => Console.WriteLine("Handler"));

state.InnerSelfTransitionOn(event2).WithHandler(i => Console.WriteLine("Handler"));

event1.Fire();
// Prints: Exit, Handler, Entry

event2.Fire()
// Prints: Handler
```


Event Data
----------

You can associate data with particular events. When you fire the event, you also provide the data.
This data is then available to [transition handlers](#transitions and [transition guards](#transition-guards).

```csharp
// This is an event which takes a string argument (but you can use any data type)
var eventWithData = new Event<string>();

state.TransitionOn(eventWithData).To(anotherState)
    .WithHandler(info => Console.WriteLine($"Data: {info.EventData}"));

// Provide the data when you fire the event
eventWithData.Fire("Some Data");

// Prints: "Data: Some Data"
```


Transition Guards
-----------------

Sometimes life isn't as simple as always transitioning from state A to state B on an event.
Sometimes when event E is fired you might transition from A to B in some cases, but from A to C in others.

One way of achieving this is with transition guards.
A transition guard is a delegate which is controls whether a particular transition can take place.
If it can't, then any other transitions from the current state on that event are tried.

Note that the order in which transitions are added to a state is important here.
Transitions are tried in the order that they were added, until either a transition succeeds or we run out of transitions (in which case the event fire will fail).

```csharp
bool allowTransitionToStateB = false;

stateA.TransitionOn(eventE).To(stateB).WithGuard(info => allowTransitionToStateB);
stateA.TransitionOn(eventE).To(stateC);

eventE.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(stateC, stateMachine.CurrentState);

// Alternatively...
allowTransitionToStateB = true;
eventE.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(stateB, stateMachine.CurrentState);
```

The guard receives an object with useful information about the transition (including any event data).

You can throw an exception from the guard: this will be propagated back to the `Event.Fire()` or `Event.TryFire()` call which initiated the transition.


Dynamic Transitions
-------------------

Dynamic transitions are the other way of allowing you to specify what state to transition to at runtime.
Instead of providing a state to transition to, you instead provide a delegate that, when called, gives the state to transition to.

These are slightly less clear than transition guards (especially when printing the state machine, see later).

```csharp
State stateToTransitionTo = stateB;

stateA.TransitionOn(eventE).ToDynamic(info => stateToTransitionTo);

eventE.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(stateB, stateMachine.CurrentState);

// Alternatively...
stateToTransitionTo = stateC;
eventE.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(stateC, stateMachine.CurrentState);
```

You can return `null` from the delegate given to `ToDynamic`, in which case the next eligible transition is attempted (i.e. the same as if the transition had a guard, which returned false).


Recursive Transitions
---------------------

You are allowed to fire events from within state entry and exit handlers, from transition handlers, and transition guards.
The event is queued until the current transition is complete, at which point it is fired.

Because events are queued, the behaviour around `Event.Fire()` and `Event.TryFire()` changes a bit.

`Event.Fire()` will never throw an exception directly, but when that event is dequeued it will throw an exception if no transition from the current state (at that point) on that event exists, and that will bubble back to whatever method (`Event.Fire()` **or** `Event.TryFire()`) was used to kick off the outermost transition.

`Event.TryFire()` will always return true.
When that event is dequeued, if no transition from the current state (at that point) on that event exists, then any queued events are not affected.
You will have no way of knowing that firing the event failed (other than the `TransitionNotFound` event on the StateMachine).

In other words, the behaviour of `Event.Fire()` is not "I will throw an exception if I fail", but rather "I will cause *something* to throw an exception if I fail, although that may not be this call".
Likewise the behaviour of `Event.TryFire()` is "I will attempt to fire, but will not cause anything to throw an exception if I fail, and will indicate my failure by returning false if possible".


Exceptions and Faulting
-----------------------

State entry/exit handlers and transition handlers may not throw exceptions.
(If exceptions were allowed, then these handlers may not run to completion, and it would be impossible to guarentee the integrity of the state machine).

If one of these handlers does throw an exception, then a `TransitionFailedException` will be thrown, and the state machine will enter a faulted state.
The `Faulted` event on the StateMachine will also be raised, and its `Fault` property will contain information about the fault.

When a state machine has faulted, no more transitions may occur, and the current state may not be queried.
The state machine will raise the `Faulted` event, then `IsFaulted` property returns true, and the `Fault` property will give information on the fault.
The only way to recovert is to call `Reset()` on the state machine, which will reset it to its initial state and clear the fault.

Transition guards and dynamic transition state selectors may throw exceptions: these exceptions are propagated back to the `Event.Fire()` or `Event.TryFire()` call which initiated the transition, and the transition will not occur.


State Groups
------------

State groups provide a lightweight alternative to full-blown hierarchical state machines (documented below).
A state group can contain one or more states, and a state can be part of one of more state groups.

State groups have an `IsCurrent` property, which indicates whether any of their states are current.
This can be useful if you have, for example, multiple states which together indicate that a device is connecting to another device.
You can add all of these 'connecting' states to a state group, and use the state groups 'IsCurrent' property to determine whether the state machine is in any of the states related to connecting.

State groups also have their own Exit and Entry handlers.
The Entry handler is invoked if the state machine transitions from a state which is not part of the state group, to a state which is.
Likewise the Exit handler is invoked if the state machine transitions from a state which is part of the state group to a state which is not.

```csharp
var stateA = stateMachine.CreateState("State A");
var stateB = stateMachine.CreateState("State B");

// You can create state groups, and add states to them
var statesAAndB = new StateGroup("States A and B")
    .WithEntry(info => Console.WriteLine($"Entering group from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}"))
    .WithExit(info => Console.WriteLine($"Exiting group from {info.From} to {info.To} on {info.Event}"));

statesAAndB.AddStates(stateA, stateB);

// You can also add states to groups
stateA.AddToGroup(statesAAndB);
```


Child State Machines
--------------------

StateMechanic supports fully hierarchical state machines.
The model is that any state may have a single child state machine, which are fully-fledges state machines in their own right.

Child state machines start by not existing in any state (`CurrentState` is `null`).
When a sparent tate machine transitions to a state which has a child state machine, that child state machine will also transition to its initial state.
This child state machine is now active.

When a parent state machine transitions away from a state which has a child state machine, that child state machine will first transition away from its current state.
The parent state machine will then transition to the next state.

The order in which handlers are called is detailed in the code example below.

When an event is fired, any active child state machines are given the opportunity to handle the event: if a transition exists from the child machine's current state to another state, then that transition will be invoked.
If no transitions are found, then the parent of that child attempts to handle the event, and so on.

States belonging to a state machine may not transition to states belonging to a different (parent or child) state machine.
The only way that a child state machine can be exited is if a transition occurs on its parent which changes the current state away from the state which owns that child state machine.

A state machine's `CurrentState` will never refer to a state belonging to a child state machine.
The `CurrentChildState` property will, however, refer to the child-most active state.

All of this is quite confusing!
Here's an example to hopefully clear the smoke.

```csharp
var parentStateMachine = new StateMachine("Parent");

var disconnected = parentStateMachine.CreateInitialState("Disconnected");
var connectingSuperState = parentStateMachine.CreateState("ConnectingSuperState");
var connectedSuperState = parentStateMachine.CreateState("ConnectedSuperState");

// 'Connecting' child state machine
var connectingStateMachine = connectingSuperState.CreateChildStateMachine("ConnectingSM");
var connectingInitialise = connectingStateMachine.CreateInitialState("ConnectingInitialisation");
var connecting = connectingStateMachine.CreateState("Connecting");
var handshaking = connectingStateMachine.CreateState("Handshaking");

// 'Connected' child state machine
var connectedStateMachine = connectedSuperState.CreateChildStateMachine("ConnectedSM");
var authorising = connectedStateMachine.CreateInitialState("Authorising");
var connected = connectedStateMachine.CreateState("Connected");

// Events
var eventConnect = new Event("Connect");
var eventConnectionInitialised = new Event("Connecting Initialised");
var eventConnected = new Event("Connected");
var eventHandshakingCompleted = new Event("Handshaking Completed");
var eventAuthorisingCompleted = new Event("Authorising Completed");
var eventDisconnected = new Event("Disconnected");

disconnected.TransitionOn(eventConnect).To(connectingSuperState);
connectingInitialise.TransitionOn(eventConnectionInitialised).To(connecting);
connecting.TransitionOn(eventConnected).To(handshaking);
handshaking.TransitionOn(eventDisconnected).To(connecting);
connectingSuperState.TransitionOn(eventHandshakingCompleted).To(connectedSuperState);
authorising.TransitionOn(eventAuthorisingCompleted).To(connected);
connectingSuperState.TransitionOn(eventDisconnected).To(disconnected);
connectedSuperState.TransitionOn(eventDisconnected).To(disconnected);


// This is a "successful" path through the system

// We start off in the initial state
Assert.AreEqual(disconnected, parentStateMachine.CurrentState);
// And the child state machines are not active
Assert.False(connectingStateMachine.IsActive);

// This causes a transition from disconnected -> connectingSuperState. Since connectingSuperState
// has a child state machine, this is activated and its initial state connectingInitialise is entered.
// The following events therefore occur:
// 1. Disconnected's Exit Handler is called. From=Disconnected, To=ConnectingSuperState
// 2. The transition handler from Disconnected to ConnectingSuperState is called. From=Disconnected,
//    To=ConnectingSuperState
// 3. ConnectingSuperState's Entry Handler is called. From=Disconnected, To=ConnectingSuperState
// 4. ConnectingInitialisation's Entry Handler is called. From=Disconnected, To=ConnectingInitialisation
// 5. The Transition event on the parentStateMachine is raised
eventConnect.Fire();

// The parent state machine's 'CurrentState' is the topmost current state
Assert.AreEqual(connectingSuperState, parentStateMachine.CurrentState);
// While its 'CurrentChildState' property indicates the currently-active child state machine's state
Assert.AreEqual(connectingInitialise, parentStateMachine.CurrentChildState);

// The child state machine knows that it is active
Assert.True(connectingStateMachine.IsActive);
// And knows what its current state is
Assert.AreEqual(connectingInitialise, connectingStateMachine.CurrentState);

// When this event is fired, the currently active child state machine (which is connectingStateMachine)
// is given the chance to handle the event. Since there's a valid transition (from connectingInitialise
// to connecting), this transition takes place
eventConnectionInitialised.Fire();

// As before, this indicates the currently-active child state
Assert.AreEqual(connecting, parentStateMachine.CurrentChildState);

// Again, this is handled by the child state machine
eventConnected.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(handshaking, parentStateMachine.CurrentChildState);

// This is passed to the child state machine, but that does not know how to handle it, so it bubbles
// up to the parent state machine. This causes a transition from connectingSuperState to
// connectedSuperState. This causes a number of things, in order:
// 1. Handshaking's Exit Handler is called. From=Handshaking, To=ConnectedSuperState
// 2. ConnectingSuperState's Exit Handler is called. From=ConnectingSuperState, To=ConnectedSuperState
// 3. The transition handler for the transition between ConnectingSuperState and ConnectedSuperState
//    is called
// 4. ConnectedSuperState's Entry Handler is called. From=ConnectingSuperState, To=ConnectedSuperState
// 5. Authorising's Entry Handler is called. From=ConnectingSuperState, To=Authorising
// 6. The Transition event on the parentStateMachine is raised
eventHandshakingCompleted.Fire();

Assert.True(authorising.IsCurrent);

// This is another transition solely inside a child state machine, from authorising to connected
eventAuthorisingCompleted.Fire();

// This is another event which is first sent to the child state machine, then bubbled up to its parent
// state machine. It causes the following things to occur:
// 1. Connected's Exit Handler is called. From=Connected, To=Disconnected
// 2. ConnectedSuperState's Exit Handler is called. From=ConnectedSuperState, To=Disconnected
// 3. The transition handler from ConnectedSuperState to Disconnected is called.
//    From=ConnectedSuperState, To=Disconnected
// 4. Disconnected's Entry Handler is called. From=ConnectedSuperState, To=Disconnected
// 5. The Transition event on the parentStateMachine is raised
eventDisconnected.Fire();

Assert.AreEqual(disconnected, parentStateMachine.CurrentState);

// Here we show that firing 'disconnected' while in 'connecting' transitions to 'disconnected'.
// I won't go into as much detail as the previous example.
eventConnect.Fire();
eventConnectionInitialised.Fire();
eventConnected.Fire();
// This will be handled by the child state machine
eventDisconnected.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(connecting, parentStateMachine.CurrentChildState);
```


Forced Transitions
------------------

Forced transitions are a mechism for forcibly transitioning between two states, regardless of whether there's a defined transition between them.
They're strongly discouraged - the whole advantage of a state machine is that the possible transitions between states is very clear and explicit, and forced transitions violate this - but sometimes there's no alternative.

When you force a transition, you specify the state to transition to, and an event.
The event is passed to state exit and entry handlers (you're pretending that that event caused the transition), but that is all.

You may force a transition to any state, even ones that belong to child or parent state machines, and the appropriate exit and entry handlers will be called.



Thread Safety
-------------

StateMechanic is not thread safe by default.

It does however provide a mechanism for providing thread safety.
You can assign an `IStateMachineSynchronizer` to the `StateMachine.Synchronizer` property.
Methods on the synchronizer will be invoked when events are fired, and the synchronizer ensures that these are given to the rest of the StateMachine in a thread-safe way (i.e. one at a time).
See the remarks on that interface for more information.

A simple locking implementation, `LockingStateMachineSynchronizer`, exists.
This will cause calls to `Event.Fire()`, `Event.TryFire()`, `StateMachine.Reset()`, and `StateMachine.ForceTransition()` to block until any preceding transitions have finished.

It is never safe to set up a state machine from multiple threads.

Note that it is not recommended to perform long-running or blocking operations in any handlers: this leaves the state machine in a mid-way point between two states, which is inconsistent.
Instead, use a state to represent the fact that the long-running operation is ongoing, but don't block any handlers to perform this operation (e.g. 'Connecting'), and transition away from it when the operation completes.


Serialization
-------------

It can be useful to serialize a state machine, for example to a database, and restore it to a later date.

StateMechanic supports this, with the following restrictions:

1. The state machine which is deserialized into must be identical to that which was serialized. If it is not, deserialization may produce the wrong result, or it may fail completely.
2. The serialization format may change between minor StateMechanic versions. This will cause deserialization to fail in a controlled manner.

For example:

```csharp
var stateMachine = new StateMachine();
var stateA = stateMachine.CreateInitialState("StateA");
var stateB = stateMachine.CreateState("StateB");

var evt = new Event();
stateA.TransitionOn(evt).To(stateB);

// Move us out of the default state
evt.Fire();
Assert.AreEqual(stateB, stateMachine.CurrentState);

string serialized = stateMachine.Serialize();

// Reset the state machine
stateMachine.Reset();
Assert.AreEqual(stateA, stateMachine.CurrentState);

// Deserialize into it
stateMachine.Deserialize(serialized);
Assert.AreEqual(stateB, stateMachine.CurrentState);
```

If you wish, you can customize how serialization occurs by implementing `IStateMachineSerializer<TState>`, then setting the `StateMachine.Serializer` property.


Printing State Machines
-----------------------

It's very useful to be able to visualise your state machines: it lets you easily spot and debug mistakes you made when setting it up, and they make fantastic inputs to your documentation ("this is our state machine, and I know that it's correct").

StateMechanic can take a state machine and create a [DGML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn966108.aspx) or [Graphviz DOT](http://www.graphviz.org/content/dot-language) file.

DGML files can be rendered and subsequently edited in Visual Studio.
Call `StateMachine.FormatDgml()` and copy the output.
Create a new "Directed Graph" file, open the resulting `.dgml` file in a text editor, and paste the DGML you copied earlier in.


Graphviz DOT files can be rendered to a utility using the `dot` executable included in the Graphviz package (or [loads](http://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) [of](http://sandbox.kidstrythisathome.com/erdos/) [online](http://stamm-wilbrandt.de/GraphvizFiddle) [utilities](http://www.webgraphviz.com)).
Call `StateMachine.FormatDot()`, copy the output, and paste into a suitable utility.


Custom State Subclasses
-----------------------

StateMechanic allows you to use your own classes for states, instead of the built-in `State`.
This allows you to do two things.

Firstly, you can add data to your states (in the form of properties), and this is available entry/exit/transition handlers.
This means you can make decisions in your handlers based on information attached to the states you're transitioning from and to, for example moving to a "Log In" state if the page being navigated to requries user authentication.

Secondly, it allows you to write entry/exit handler logic in a class, rather than as a delegate.
This may help you to improve the structure of complex state machines.

The are two ways specify custom state classes: a custom base state for the entire state machine, and custom state classes for individual states.

### Custom Base State

By default, the `State` class is used everywhere in StateMechanic, when looking at e.g. `StateMachine.CurrentState`, in information given to various handlers, etc.
However, you can use your own class here if you wish.

First, derive from `StateBase<T>`.
The `T` here has to be a reference to your class type: this is an unfortunate artefact of C#'s type system, and is checked at runtime.
Then create a `new StateMachine<YourStateSubclass>()`, and use it as normal.

```csharp
class CustomBaseState : StateBase<CustomBaseState>
{
    // You can add your own properties
    public bool SomeProperty { get; set; }

    // There are various methods you can override
}

var stateMachine = new StateMachine<CustomBaseState>();
CustomBaseState initial = stateMachine.CreateInitialState("Initial");
initial.SomeProperty = true;

// Properties on stateMachine refer to CustomStates
CustomBaseState currentState = stateMachine.CurrentState;
```

### Custom Individual States

You can also use different classes for individual states - this is most useful when the state class contains entry/exit/guard handler logic.

Create a class which derives from `State`.
If you have created a custom base state, as above, you need to derive from that.

You class must only have a public parameterless constructor

```csharp
class InitialState : State
{
    // There are various methods you can override
}

var stateMachine = new StateMachine();
InitialState initial = stateMachine.CreateInitialState<InitialState>("Initial");
```

### State Groups

If you want to make a state group which contains your custom base state type, create a `new StateGroup<CustomBaseState>()`.
